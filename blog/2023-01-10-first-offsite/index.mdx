My first tech job was at [Strong](https://www.strong.app/), a workout journal app that was pretty popular at the time. The founders were “digital nomads,” and the team was fully remote.

Back in 2016, this was highly uncommon.

We spent a lot of time creating processes to work together effectively on opposite sides of the world. One of these was meeting up in person regularly.

At first, it was by accident. Since everyone was traveling anyway, we would coordinate being in the same city at the same time.

After working in person, we quickly noticed the way we worked remotely improved. People were more comfortable sharing their ideas, better at giving constructive criticism, and happier in general.

It just _felt_ better to work together in person.

## Why try this at Firezone?

If you believe Firezone can take a sizable bite out of the usual suspects of legacy remote access products, we'll need to use every advantage we have.

As a startup, our biggest advantage is the ability to move quickly as a team.

This is much easier when everyone is comfortable sharing ideas and engaging in lively debate. Plus, it’s a lot more fun.

So, we decided to try it out. After much planning, canceled bookings, and a few long flights later, our team met up in Santa Rosa, California.

## What did we do?

Our itinerary included architecture planning, a multi-day hackathon, and plenty of fun activities around the Bay Area. 

The focus of the off-site was building. We each defined a few tasks that could realistically be completed by the end of the trip. Here's a short summary of what we accomplished:

* REST API v0: Many IT teams use our snappy web portal to support hundreds of concurrent users without a hitch. However, we’d prefer if you rarely had to open it up. [PR here](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/pull/1155).
* Updating the Gateway: The Firezone gateway is tightly coupled with the control plane. To support larger teams with multi-site environments, we’ll need to support managing multiple gateways under a single control-plane. Work-in-progress in [this PR](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/pull/1205). 
* Docs improvements: We wrote a few new docs on debug logs, split tunnel DNS considerations, and common troubleshooting issues. Details in [this PR](https://github.com/firezone/firezone/pull/1194).

Of course, a visit to the Bay Area would not be complete without a tour of San Francisco. We visited the usual landmarks and had a lot of seafood.

Of special mention are the team dinners. As someone whose culinary talents rival his passion for building security products, Jamil (Co-founder & CEO) made our team dinners very memorable. You can follow his musings at [@jamilbk](https://twitter.com/jamilbk).

## Lessons learned for next time

Since this was our first offsite, some things could have gone better. Here’s a small list of hiccups and our learnings.

### Close your tabs!

If you’re booking an Airbnb, check for planned maintenance and outages. We were notified three days before arrival the power would be out during work hours on two weekdays.

We made it work by sharing battery banks and migrating to the local coffee shop when our batteries died. Luckily Firezone is just about peak power efficiency for a VPN, so we all gained a few extra minutes of battery.

When you're building software, electricity and internet are pretty much the only things you can't do without. Next time we'll pack a large power bank.

### Lumbar support is under-rated

You’ll sacrifice some ergonomics when you work out of an Airbnb. Put a premium on large work surfaces, open common areas, and comfortable chairs. We learned the hard way after a few days working hunched over on a sofa.

Even better, leave heads down work until after the offsite. Instead, prioritize architecture discussions, brainstorming sessions, and design sprints. 

### Stock the right fuel

We got carried away at Costco. Our out-of-town guests had never witnessed the spectacle of an American snack aisle. Fortunately, our talented engineers can turn Funyuns into elegant lines of Rust code (shoutout [@Gabi](https://github.com/conectado)). 

All jokes aside, you’ll need the right fuel for your hackathons and deep product discussions. We recommend stocking up with plenty of coffee and healthy snacks.

### Plan ahead, it will pay off

As is often the case with startups, we planned the trip on short notice. This meant many last-minute restaurant bookings and trips to the store for basic supplies.

So, make a shopping list, book a few restaurants in advance, and have a backup plan. If you're looking for a template, take a look at this [guide](https://posthog.com/handbook/company/offsites#how-to-plan-an-offsite-in-8-weeks---a-checklist) from our friends at PostHog. A great checklist is hard to beat.

## What’s next?

In a few short days, we:
* Aligned on Firezone’s product direction
* Made critical architecture decisions for the gateway and client apps
* Made significant progress on a few key features
* Bonded over great food, conversation, and Mario Kart

We could have accomplished some of these over a few long Zoom calls and chat threads, but not as quickly. There’s something about mind melding over a few days of intense work that’s hard to replicate.

So, will we have another offsite? Definitely!

You can also expect more blog posts from us. One of our New Year’s resolutions at Firezone is to write more. We want to be transparent with how we build our product, run our company, and make important decisions that impact our users. We do this because we don’t take your trust in Firezone for granted.

Until next time!
